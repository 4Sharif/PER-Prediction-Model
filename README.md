# PER
Player Efficiency Prediction Model Using NBA Advanced Stats

The coding files are meant to be viewed/used in this order:

1. split
2. modelTraining
3. crossValidation
4. featureImportance
5. modelTesting
6. modelComparison
7. predictiveTool

The first six files are the modeling steps. At the end, the 
predictive tool has the ability to take inputs from the user. 
As an example, I included 28 players in total, ranging from 
1997-2024. It will output their predicted PER based on their statistics.

Download the transformed csv dataset, copy its file path from 
your device, and insert it into "split.py." For the predictive tool 
to work, run "split.py" and then run "modelTraining.py." This is because 
of the joblib import.
