# PER
Player Efficiency Prediction Model Using NBA Advanced Stats

The coding files are meant to be viewed/used in this order:

1. split
2. modelTraining
3. crossValidation
4. featureImportance
5. modelTesting
6. modelComparison
7. predictiveTool

The first six files are the modeling steps. At the end, the 
predictive tool has the ability to take inputs from the user. 
As an example, I included 28 players in total, ranging from 
1997-2024. It will output their predicted PER based on their statistics.

For everything to work, download the transformed csv dataset, copy 
its file path from your device, and insert it in "split.py."
